   "source": "# Semantic Search Enhancement — E-Commerce Retrieval Analysis\n**Author:** Braulio Otavalo &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Date:** 2026-02-08 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Dataset:** [Wayfair WANDS](https://github.com/wayfair/WANDS)\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n- **Problem:** The baseline TF-IDF search engine achieves MAP@10 ≈ 0.29 — roughly 50–65% below production benchmarks (0.6–0.8) — indicating significant lost revenue from poor search relevance.\n- **Approach:** We evaluate four retrieval strategies (improved TF-IDF, BM25, sentence embeddings, cross-encoder reranking) across multiple metrics (MAP@10, weighted MAP@10, NDCG@10, MRR) and analyze each through a **Cost-Accuracy-Performance (CAP)** tradeoff lens.\n- **Key Finding:** Two-stage retrieval (bi-encoder recall → cross-encoder reranking) achieves the highest accuracy (MAP@10 ≈ 0.44, +51% over baseline) with acceptable latency for search result pages. Text preprocessing requires careful ablation — naive changes (removing numbers, capping features) can regress performance.\n- **Recommendation:** For production deployment, adopt a two-stage architecture with BM25/embedding first-pass retrieval followed by cross-encoder reranking. A weighted evaluation metric should be used for fairer assessment of partial matches.\n- **Partial Match Insight:** Introducing weighted MAP (Exact=1.0, Partial=0.5) and NDCG provides a fairer assessment — the baseline's strict Exact-only evaluation understates real search quality."

    "\n",
    "Search is the **primary revenue driver** for e-commerce platforms. Studies show that 30–60% of e-commerce revenue originates from search ([Coveo, 2023](https://www.coveo.com)). When search fails to surface relevant products:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conversion rates drop** — users who search are 2–3× more likely to purchase, but only if they find what they need.\n",
    "- **Bounce rates increase** — irrelevant results push users to competitors.\n",
    "- **Customer lifetime value (CLV) decreases** — repeated poor experiences erode trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current TF-IDF-based search engine achieves **MAP@10 = 0.29**, well below the **0.6–0.8** range typical of production e-commerce platforms. This gap represents a substantial revenue and user experience problem.\n",

    "### 3.4 Key Data Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partial matches are substantial** — they represent a significant portion of labels. Treating them as Irrelevant (as the baseline does) severely penalizes models that return partially relevant results.\n",
    "2. **14% missing descriptions** — the baseline concatenates `product_name + product_description`, and NaN values become literal \"NaN\" strings in the TF-IDF vocabulary. Fixing this alone could improve results.\n",
    "3. **Short queries** — most queries are 1–3 words, which means lexical methods have limited signal. Semantic understanding becomes critical for short, ambiguous queries.\n",
    "4. **Rich metadata unused** — `product_class`, `category_hierarchy`, `product_features`, and ratings are all available but ignored by the baseline.\n",
    "5. **Moderate catalog size** — 42,994 products is small enough for brute-force similarity (no ANN index needed), but large enough that corpus encoding takes meaningful time."

    "The TF-IDF baseline has several limitations that explain its low MAP@10:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No text preprocessing** — the original code does not lowercase, remove punctuation, or handle special characters. This causes vocabulary fragmentation (e.g., \"Chair\" ≠ \"chair\").\n",
    "2. **NaN pollution** — `product_description` has ~6,008 nulls. Without `.fillna(\"\")`, these become literal \"NaN\" strings in the TF-IDF vocabulary.\n",
    "3. **Lexical-only matching** — TF-IDF is a bag-of-words model. It cannot understand that \"couch\" ≈ \"sofa\" or \"desk lamp\" ≈ \"table light\".\n",
    "4. **No use of metadata** — `product_class`, `category_hierarchy`, `product_features`, and `ratings` are all ignored.\n",
    "5. **No partial match credit** — the evaluation treats Partial matches identically to Irrelevant, which overpunishes the model.\n",
    "6. **No term saturation** — TF-IDF lacks BM25's term frequency saturation, meaning documents that repeat a term many times get disproportionately high scores."

   "source": "### 7.1 Ablation Analysis — What Helped, What Hurt\n\nThe ablation study reveals a critical lesson: **not all \"improvements\" improve things.** Stacking changes without isolated testing silently degraded performance from +0.04 to -0.05.\n\n| Config | MAP@10 | Delta | Verdict |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Baseline** | **0.2932** | — | Reference |\n| A: NaN fix only | 0.2858 | -0.0073 | Slight regression — `.fillna(\"\")` removes description text for 14% of products |\n| B: NaN fix + clean | 0.2858 | -0.0073 | Identical to A — `TfidfVectorizer` already lowercases by default |\n| C: + product_class | 0.3054 | +0.0122 | Helps — adds category terms that overlap with query intent |\n| **D: + all fields** | **0.3207** | **+0.0275** | Helps more — category hierarchy adds useful hierarchical context |\n| E: D + remove numbers | 0.3189 | +0.0257 | Slightly worse than D — stripping digits loses dimension/quantity signals |\n| F: D + bigrams | 0.2435 | -0.0497 | Hurts badly — `max_features=50000` cap drops important unigrams |\n| **G: D + sublinear_tf** | **0.3333** | **+0.0401** | **Best — log TF scaling prevents long descriptions from dominating** |\n| H: all combined | 0.2408 | -0.0524 | Worst — negative effects of E+F overwhelm positive effects of D+G |\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n1. **Removing numbers hurts.** Queries like \"7 qt slow cooker\" lose matching signal when digits are stripped from both query and corpus. In e-commerce, numbers encode size, capacity, and model identifiers.\n\n2. **Bigrams with `max_features` cap is the biggest single negative.** Bigrams massively expand the vocabulary (unigrams + all adjacent pairs). Capping at 50,000 features forces the vectorizer to drop important unigrams in favor of high-frequency bigrams from long product descriptions.\n\n3. **Adding all text fields (D) is the biggest single positive.** `product_class` and `category_hierarchy` add category-level matching terms that the baseline ignores. When a user searches \"recliners\", the `product_class` field \"Recliners\" provides a direct match.\n\n4. **`sublinear_tf=True` adds +0.013 on top of D.** Log(1 + TF) scaling prevents products with very long descriptions from dominating results through raw term repetition. This is conceptually similar to BM25's term frequency saturation.\n\n5. **NaN fix alone slightly hurts.** Counterintuitively, the baseline's `astype(\"U\")` converts NaN to \"nan\" — a nonsense token that is effectively ignored by TF-IDF (low IDF). Replacing with empty string means those 6,008 products have only their name, making them harder to distinguish. The gain only materializes when combined with additional fields (C, D) that compensate for the lost description text.\n\n**Selected configuration: G** (all fields + sublinear_tf, keep numbers, unigrams only) → **MAP@10 = 0.3333 (+13.7% over baseline)**\n\n### 7.2 CAP Analysis — Text Preprocessing\n\n| Dimension | Assessment |\n|---|---|\n| **Cost** | Negligible — text cleaning runs in milliseconds, no GPU, no additional libraries |\n| **Accuracy** | Moderate gain (+0.04 MAP@10) — driven by adding metadata fields and sublinear TF scaling |\n| **Performance** | No latency impact at inference — same vectorizer, same cosine similarity |\n\n**Verdict:** Prioritizes **Cost + Performance**, with a meaningful accuracy gain. However, TF-IDF's core limitation remains lexical — it cannot bridge the vocabulary gap between \"couch\" and \"sofa\". The real improvements come from semantic methods (Sections 9–10).\n\n**Lesson for practitioners:** Always run ablation studies when changing preprocessing. In this dataset, two changes (removing numbers, capping features) were actively harmful — a result that would be invisible without isolated testing. The naive \"improved\" approach (Config H) regressed by -5.2%, while the ablation-informed approach (Config G) improved by +4.0%."

    "## 11. Hybrid Approach Analysis (Discussion Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "A hybrid retrieval strategy combines **lexical** (BM25) and **semantic** (embedding) scores to leverage the strengths of both:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query\n",
    "    ├── BM25 → top-100 (captures exact keyword matches)\n",
    "    └── Bi-Encoder → top-100 (captures semantic similarity)\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "    Score Fusion (RRF or weighted combination)\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "    Combined top-100 candidates\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "    Cross-Encoder Reranking → top-10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Hybrid?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lexical methods** excel at exact keyword matching (product model numbers, brand names, specific dimensions).\n",
    "- **Semantic methods** excel at understanding intent (\"couch\" → \"sofa\", \"desk light\" → \"table lamp\").\n",
    "- Neither alone is complete. Hybrid combines both recall sets before reranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest fusion method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "RRF_score(d) = Σ 1 / (k + rank_i(d))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `k` is a constant (typically 60) and `rank_i(d)` is the rank of document `d` in retriever `i`. RRF is parameter-free (beyond `k`) and robust to score distribution differences between methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on literature ([Elasticsearch hybrid search](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/lexical-semantic-hybrid-search), [Pinecone hybrid search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/get-started/key-concepts#hybrid-search)), hybrid retrieval typically improves recall by 5-15% over the best single method, especially for:\n",
    "- Queries with brand names or model numbers (BM25 captures these)\n",
    "- Queries with synonyms or paraphrases (embeddings capture these)\n",
    "\n",
    "### CAP Analysis — Hybrid\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | Assessment |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Cost** | 🔴 High — sum of both BM25 and embedding costs, plus fusion logic |\n",
    "| **Accuracy** | 🟢 Expected to outperform either method alone |\n",
    "| **Performance** | 🟡 Slightly slower than either alone (parallel retrieval + fusion step) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verdict:** Prioritizes **Accuracy**, trades off **Cost + Performance**. This is the current best practice in production systems — Elasticsearch 8+, Vespa, and Weaviate all support hybrid search natively."

    "1. **First Pass (Recall):** Hybrid BM25 + bi-encoder retrieval with RRF fusion → top-100 candidates\n",

    "- Reranking cost is bounded and independent of catalog size\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.2 What I Would Do with More Time & Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fine-tune embeddings on WANDS domain data** — the generic `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model has no knowledge of furniture terminology. Domain-specific fine-tuning (using the labeled query-product pairs as training data) could significantly improve embedding quality. Expected impact: +10-20% MAP improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query expansion with LLMs** — use a language model to expand short queries (\"lamp\" → \"table lamp, desk lamp, floor lamp\") before retrieval. This addresses the vocabulary mismatch problem at the query level.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Learning-to-rank (LTR) with domain features** — combine retrieval scores with product-level features (ratings, review counts, price, category match) in a gradient-boosted ranking model (LambdaMART). This is the industry standard for final ranking in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **A/B testing framework** — implement online evaluation to compare retrieval strategies using real user engagement metrics (CTR, add-to-cart rate, purchase rate). Offline metrics (MAP, NDCG) are proxies; online metrics are the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User click-through feedback loop** — collect implicit feedback from user interactions (clicks, purchases, dwell time) to continuously improve retrieval models. This creates a virtuous cycle: better search → more interactions → better training data → even better search.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluate larger embedding models** — with GPU resources, test `e5-large-v2` or `bge-large-en-v1.5` for potentially higher accuracy at the cost of increased latency and compute."
